This is a web application developed using PHP and MySQL. 
I wanted to create a project such as this to go in depth on authentication, CRUD, and working with WebSockets.
Some of the features that I've implemented are: 

Email verification after registration 
- if an email or username is in use, the user will have to choose a different username and or email

One to One (DM) Messaging

Update/Manage Profile Picture, Bio, even your username

Status (when someone is online vs offline)



What I will add: 

WebSocket to offer realtime chatting across the server

Forgot Password? option

Add Friends



I wanted to give myself a challenge, and so far I've been able to work through adding certain features. 
- The real challenge will be adding a websocket, as I will need to read through documentation to achieve
real time chatting.
