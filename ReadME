This is a web application developed using PHP and MySQL. 
I wanted to create a project such as this to go in depth on authentication, CRUD, and working with WebSockets.
Some of the features that I've implemented are: 

Email verification after registration 
- if an email or username is in use, the user will have to choose a different username and or email

One to One (DM) Messaging

Update/Manage Profile Picture, Bio, even your username

Status (when someone is online vs offline)



What I will add: 

WebSocket to offer realtime chatting across the server

Forgot Password? option

Add Friends



I wanted to give myself a challenge, and so far I've been able to work through adding certain features. 
- The real challenge was working with the Websocket and sending the data across the server. In this project, I feel that I've grown with the use of JavaScript, JSON, and ajax. 
I feel that I've accomplished a lot, and that I've also grown a lot within my code. I went from creating basic HTML & CSS templates 4 months ago to create dynamic web chat applications.


I was able to brush up on my SQL querying, using inner joins, and performing other CRUD methods via the DB. Backend programming is an amazing, and extensive part of development, and it always provides a challenge.
